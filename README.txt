
To run the program:
1. type in "make"
(type in values for the following varaibles: nBUffers nWorkers sleepMin Sleepmax RandSeed lock)
2. type in "./friendship nBuffers nWorkers [ sleepMin sleepMax ] [ randSeed ] [ -lock | -nolock ].
EXAMPLE: "./friendship 11 10 .1 .2 0 -unlock"
3. When running simulation with "lock" please be patient. It might take a bit of time depending on # of Buffers and Workers.
